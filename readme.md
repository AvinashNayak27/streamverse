# Streamverse Backend

Streamverse is a decentralized video platform that leverages the capabilities of Superfluid and Livepeer to offer unique features such as real-time ad campaigns and premium subscriptions.

## Features

1. **Video Uploads using Livepeer**: Livepeer is a decentralized video streaming network built on the Ethereum blockchain. By using Livepeer, Streamverse can allow users to upload and stream videos in a decentralized manner, ensuring censorship resistance and potentially lower costs compared to centralized solutions.

2. **Ad Campaigns using Superfluid SUbscriptions**:
   - Advertisers can set up a continuous stream of payments using Superfluid Subscriptions to run their ads on Streamverse.
   - The continuous stream ensures that the ad keeps running as long as the stream is active.
   - If an advertiser decides to cancel their stream, their ad is automatically removed from Streamverse. This gives advertisers flexibility and ensures they only pay for the duration their ad is active.

3. **Premium Subscription using Superfluid Subsriptions**:
   - Users can set up a continuous stream of payments to Streamverse to enjoy an ad-free experience.
   - As long as their stream is active, they won't see any ads on the platform.
   - If a user decides to stop their stream, they will start seeing ads again. This provides a seamless experience for users, allowing them to easily switch between premium and regular modes.

4. **Benefits**:
   - **For Advertisers**: They have granular control over their ad campaigns. They can start or stop campaigns in real-time based on their budget and needs.
   - **For Users**: They have the flexibility to choose between a regular experience with ads or a premium ad-free experience. The continuous payment stream ensures they only pay for the duration they want the premium service.
   - **For Streamverse**: The platform can potentially reduce overhead costs by leveraging decentralized services. It also offers a unique value proposition compared to traditional video platforms.
